    KADANE'S ALGORITHM

    Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm to find the maximum sum contiguous subarray of a
    one-dimensional numeric list.

    Average Runtime:    O(n)
    Worst Runtime:      O(n)
    Best Runtime:       O(n)
    Space Complexity:   O(1)
    Alg Paradigm:       Dynamic Programming/Greedy
    Online:             YES      (can search a list as it receives it)

# Maximum Sublist Sum Via Kadane's Algorithm
#
# NOTE: Initialize with the first list value (l[0]), as opposed to 0.  This is necessary to cover the case where ALL
#       list values are NEGATIVE (if all values were negative and 0 was used, then 0, would be returned, NOT a negative
#       sum).
#
# This approach simply maintains a result sum, and a current sublist sum, which are updated during a single iteration
# over the list values.  The current sublist sum is updated first, and then, if the result needs to be updated, it is
# updated second.
#
# Time Complexity: O(N)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
