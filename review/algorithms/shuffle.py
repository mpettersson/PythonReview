    SHUFFLE

    The Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle (1938) is an algorithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence.  The alg
    produces an unbiased permutation: every permutation is equally likely.

    The Durstenfeld Shuffle (1964), as popularized by Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming", is more efficient than
    Fisher-Yates version.

    The (Modern Approach) shuffle below is often referred to as the Fisher-Yates or Knuth Shuffle.
