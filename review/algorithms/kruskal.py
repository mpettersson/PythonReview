    KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM

    TODO:
        - CONSIDER ADDING AN ADJACENCY LIST VERSION
        - REVIEW DESCRIPTION
        - ADD ASYMPTOTIC COMPLEXITIES

    Kruskal's algorithm finds a MINIMUM SPANNING FOREST of an UNDIRECTED edge-WEIGHTED graph. If the graph is connected,
    it finds a minimum spanning tree. (A minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is a subset of the edges that forms
    a tree that includes every vertex, where the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree is minimized. For a
    disconnected graph, a minimum spanning forest is composed of a minimum spanning tree for each connected component.)
    It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as in each step it adds the next lowest-weight edge that will not form a
    cycle to the minimum spanning forest.

    Average Runtime:    O(E log E) time, or equivalently, O(E log V) TODO
    Worst Runtime:      O() TODO
    Best Runtime:       O() TODO
    Space Complexity:   O() TODO
    Alg Paradigm:       Greedy Minimum Spanning Tree

    Graph Properties:
        - Graph must be UNDIRECTED.
        - Graph must be WEIGHTED (todo: can it have negative weights?).
        - Graph CAN have cycles.
        - Graph can be CONNECTED OR DISCONNECTED.

    This algorithm first appeared in Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, pp. 48â€“50 in 1956, and was
    written by Joseph Kruskal.

    Algorithm:
        Given a forest F (a set of trees), where each vertex in the graph is a separate tree.
        1.  Create a set S containing all the edges in the graph.
        2.  While S is nonempty and F is not yet spanning:
            2.1  Remove an edge with minimum weight from S
            2.2  If the removed edge connects two   different trees then add it to the forest F, combining two trees into
                 a single tree.
        At the termination of the algorithm, the forest forms a minimum spanning forest of the graph. If the graph is
        connected, the forest has a single component and forms a minimum spanning tree.
