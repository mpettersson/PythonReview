# PythonReview

Most coders are polyglots, add aging, or volatile, memories and a need for reference and review content (for any given
language) arises.  

The two main components of this repo are; a basic yet thorough review of Python 3, and a broad set of programming 
questions and corresponding answers (implemented in Python 3). 


## Python Language Review



## Python Programming Questions & Solutions

At present, the majority of the programming questions are based on questions found in

by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com/) and
