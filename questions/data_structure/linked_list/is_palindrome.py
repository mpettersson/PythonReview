    IS PALINDROME (CCI 2.6: PALINDROME,
                   50CIQ 30: PALINDROMES)

    Write a function, which accepts the head of a linked list, and returns True if the linked list is a palindrome,
    False otherwise.

    Example:
        Input:  t -> a -> c -> o -> c -> -> a -> t -> None
        Output: True

# Questions you should ask the interviewer (if not explicitly stated):
#   - What time/space complexity are you looking for?
#   - What data types will the stack contain?
#   - Singly or doubly linked list?
#   - Verify the definition of a palindrome.


# APPROACH: Naive Via Stack
#
# Traverse the list once, pushing each of the values (of the WHOLE list) in a stack, then traverse the list once more
# comparing the values along the way.  If the values do not match, return False, else if all the values matched, return
# True.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

# APPROACH: Via Recursion Stack
#
# This approach makes use of the call stack to store the values to compare.  Note that this version stores HALF the list
# in the call stack at the cost of first finding the length of the list.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

# APPROACH: Via (Half) Stack Optimal
#
# Use a fast/slow pointer to find half the list, then just add half of the list to a stack to compare. Although this has
# the same Big O complexities as above the space is half of the first approach, and unlike the second approach, the
# length is not needed.
#
# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
# Space Complexity: O(n/2), which reduces to O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
