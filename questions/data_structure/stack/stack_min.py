    STACK MIN (CCI 3.2)

    How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum
    element?  Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.

# NOTE: TWO of the following three solutions use python lists, in a first in last out (FILO) order, as a replacement for
# node/stack classes to (minimally) cut down on the length/complexity of the code.  In an interview you would want to
# ask the interviewer if this substitution was acceptable.


# Stack (Value, Min) Approach: One (less efficient) solution is for each stack node to contain both value and min. Push
# pop and min operate in O(1), space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack.
# This, however, would be inefficient if; for example, if the first pushed value was the min of the whole stack the min
# value would be duplicated many times.
