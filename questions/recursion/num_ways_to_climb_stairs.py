    NUMBER OF WAYS TO CLIMB STAIRS (EPI 17.10: COUNT THE NUMBER OF MOVES TO CLIMB STAIRS)

    Write a program, which accepts the number of stairs (n) in a stairwell and the maximum number of stairs a person may
    be able to advance at a time (k), and computes (then returns) the number of ways said person can climb to the top of
    the (n) stairs.

    Example:
        Input = 4, 2    # n, k
        Output = 5      # or these combinations of steps [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2]

# Questions you should ask the interviewer (if not explicitly stated):
#   - What time/space complexity are you looking for?
#   - Input Validation?
#   - Clarify and verify assumptions about the question (order matters, output formatting, etc.)?


# NOTE: IF there is ONE variable (with a few extra rules) then it MAY be easier to write down concrete examples first
# then try to deduce the relation.  However, when there is more than one variable, expand the function FIRST and try
# to find the recurrence relation, THEN try real examples.
#
# First find a recurrence:
#   f(n,k) = f(n-1,k) + f(n-2,k) + ... + f(n-(k-1),k) + f(n-k,k)
#   f(n,k) = Î£(n-i,k), for i=1 to k.
#
# Then test the recurrence:
#   f(4,2) = f(4-1,2) + f(4-2,2) = f(3,2) + f(2,2) = 3 + 2
#   f(3,2) = f(3-1,2) + f(3-2,2) = f(2,2) + f(1,2) = 2 + 1
#   f(2,2) = f(2-1,2) + f(2-2,2) = f(1,2) + f(0,2) = 1 + 1
#   f(1,2) = 1
#   f(0,2) = 1


# APPROACH: Recursive
#
# This is a plain recursive approach, which for each value of k that is less than or equal to the number of remaining
# stairs, recursively collates then returns the results (of the recursive call).
#
# Time Complexity: O(n ** k).
# Space Complexity: O(n).

# APPROACH: Memoization/Top Down Dynamic Programming
#
# This approach has the same logic as the recursive approach above, however, a memoization cache has been added to
# eliminate duplicate (recursive) calls.  The recursive function now checks whether the cache contains the initial value
# or computed result for the the current stair count.  If the result exists, then it is simply returned, if not, then
# the recursive call is executed and the value is updated.
#
# Time complexity is O(n * k).
# Space complexity is O(n).
