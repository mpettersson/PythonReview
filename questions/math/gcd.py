    GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR (GCD)

    In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest
    positive integer that divides each of the integers.

    In the name "greatest common divisor", the adjective "greatest" may be replaced by "highest", and the word "divisor"
    may be replaced by "factor", so that other names include greatest common factor (gcf), etc.  Historically, other
    names for the same concept have included greatest common measure.
