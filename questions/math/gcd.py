    GCD (GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR)

    In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest
    positive integer that divides each of the integers.  In the name "greatest common divisor", the adjective "greatest"
    may be replaced by "highest", and the word "divisor" may be replaced by "factor", so that other names include
    greatest common factor (gcf), etc.  Historically, other names for the same concept have included greatest common
    measure.   SEE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm

    Write a function that returns the gcd of two supplied integers.

    Example:
        Input = 8, 12
        Output = 4

    Variations:
        - Same as above, however, *, /, or % operators may not be used. (EPI 25.1: COMPUTE THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR)

# More GCD Rules:
#   - Zero cannot be a GCD, since anything divided by zero is undefined.
#   - The GCD of a non-zero number and zero will always be the non-zero number.
#   - The GCD a negative numbers will always be the GCD of the absolute value of the negative numbers.
#   - The GCD of a (non-zero) number and itself is always the number.
